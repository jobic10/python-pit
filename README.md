# Python Pit
#### Weird repo name? Yeah, I figured :-)
Created this Repository to push code I wrote in python. 
I am not concerned about the complexity (time and space); I was just writing the code as it occured.
Sometime in future, I'd surely optimize the code; feel free to make a request to optimize with me :-). Learning never ends.
